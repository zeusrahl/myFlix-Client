In this activity, I'm building components using the React library to help process the information for my myFlix API from a previous excercise.

As of Aug. 29, 2021, I have created my first `index` component, and have run `parcel src/index.html` to initialize the use of the website. It is very simple, with "Good morning" being the only text, colored `steelblue`.
